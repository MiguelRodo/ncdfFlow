====================

To build the ncdfFlow package from source, make sure that HDF5 Library is present on your system:

If HDF5 is installed to some non-standard location, you may pass the environment variable --with-hdf5 
to point to the correct location of HDF5, for example,
R CMD INSTALL ncdfFlow_x.y.z.tar.gz --configure-args="--with-hdf5='/path/to'"
under '/path/to', you should find "include" and "lib" sub-folders that contain HDF5 headers and shared libraries.
